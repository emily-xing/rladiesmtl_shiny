### Getting started

*Please make sure you have R and RStudio first.*

1. Duplicate the contents of this folder(rladiesmtl_shiny), including the .Rproj file, data, and the Shiny app code. You can use ```git clone``` to clone this directory or download the files individually. 

2. Launch the 20181410_Intro_Shiny.Rproj file on RStudio. RStudio will set your working directory to this project file. You can verify this using getwd().
